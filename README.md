Tetrahedron with text for 3D printing

**Language: OpenSCAD**

**Start: 2022**

## Why
I wanted to 3D-print an object I find useful when I think about [chiral chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)). It's a [tetrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron) (i.e., a triangular pyramid) with letters written on it to identify the vertices. I tried to prepare the STL file needed for the printing with a CAD ([FreeCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeCAD) to be precise), but my CAD skills were too rusty and I found the whole experience a bit frustrating. I looked for a solution more suited to a software developer and I found [OpenSCAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSCAD) which is an application for creating solid 3D CAD objects using a simple programming language.
